# ANN Model on MNIST Dataset

1. Objective
The objective of this project is to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9. The model is aimed at achieving high accuracy in digit recognition by learning the patterns from the dataset through multiple layers of neurons.

2. Services the Model Provides
Digit Recognition: The trained ANN model can accurately predict the handwritten digit (0-9) in an image.
Model Evaluation: It provides metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for evaluating the modelâ€™s performance.
Scalable Solution: The model can be fine-tuned and scaled to handle other image classification tasks with minor adjustments.

3. Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
TensorFlow / Keras: For building and training the ANN model.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the results.
scikit-learn: For additional utilities like train-test splitting and metrics.

4. Resources
Dataset: MNIST Dataset, a collection of 70,000 handwritten digit images.
